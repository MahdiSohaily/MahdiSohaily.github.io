              Hi! My name is Mahdi Rezaei, and I&#x27;m a full-stack software
              developer.\n\nI specialize in using TypeScript, React, Redux, and
              Laravel to build software solutions for small businesses.\n\nI
              have worked as a software developer for one year in the Ministry
              of Energy and Water. There I have been working with other groups
              of software developers in a stressful, fast-paced environment, so
              I have already learned how to manage stressful situations, remain
              calm, work collaboratively and behave professionally in a
              group.\n\nI am currently completing the Microverse Boot Camp, a
              remote software development Bootcamp that allows programmers to
              plan and build projects together.\n\n\nIn my free time, I love
              spending time with my family and friends &amp; reading books. I
              love running, and video games!\n\nFront-End: JavaScript,
              TypeScript, React.js, Redux, Vue.js, Next.js.\nBack-End: Laravel,
              Spring Boot.\nDatabases: MongoDB, MySQL.\nTools and Methods: Git,
              GitHub, Netlify, Webpack, TDD, RSpec.\n\nLooking for a developer?
              Let&#x27;s schedule a zoom call! You can send me an e-mail at
              mahdi.sohaily4030@gmail.com, or check out my profile at
